### 1. Overview

This document provides internal documentation for the `changelog.component.ts` file, which defines an Angular component responsible for displaying a changelog.  Currently, the component is minimally implemented and does not contain any significant logic beyond the basic Angular component lifecycle.  Future development will likely involve fetching and rendering changelog data from a backend source or a local file.


### 2. Component Structure

The `ChangelogComponent` is a simple Angular component. Let's break down its structure:

#### 2.1 `@Component` Decorator

The `@Component` decorator configures the component's metadata:

| Property       | Value                    | Description                                                                   |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `selector`      | `'app-changelog'`       | The CSS selector that Angular uses to identify and insert this component into the application's template. |
| `templateUrl`   | `'./changelog.component.html'` | The path to the component's HTML template.                                    |
| `styleUrls`     | `['./changelog.component.css']` | An array of paths to the component's CSS style sheets.                     |


#### 2.2 `constructor()` Method

```typescript
constructor() {
}
```

The constructor is currently empty.  In a more complete implementation, it might be used to inject dependencies necessary for fetching or processing changelog data (e.g., an HTTP client for fetching data from a server).


#### 2.3 `ngOnInit()` Method

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
}
```

The `ngOnInit()` lifecycle hook is currently empty.  This method is typically used for performing initialization tasks after Angular has fully initialized the component.  In a future iteration, this might contain code to fetch and display the changelog data.  For example, it could make a call to a service to retrieve changelog entries and then update the component's properties to reflect the received data.  The data would then be displayed using the `changelog.component.html` template.
