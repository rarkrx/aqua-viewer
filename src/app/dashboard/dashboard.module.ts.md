# DashboardModule Documentation

[TOC]

## 1. Overview

The `DashboardModule` is an Angular module responsible for declaring and exporting the `DashboardComponent`.  It imports necessary Angular Material modules for UI elements used within the `DashboardComponent`. This module encapsulates the components and dependencies required for the dashboard functionality.


## 2. Module Structure

The `DashboardModule` utilizes the standard Angular `@NgModule` decorator to define its structure.

| Property       | Description                                                                    | Value                                         |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `imports`       | Modules imported and used within this module.                               | `MatCardModule`, `MatButtonModule`              |
| `exports`       | Modules or components exported for use in other modules.                         | `[]` (Empty array - nothing is explicitly exported) |
| `declarations` | Components, directives, and pipes declared in this module.                    | `DashboardComponent`                           |
| `providers`     | Services that should be created with the module's injector.                   | `[]` (Empty array - no providers are defined)     |


## 3. Imported Modules

* **`@angular/material/card`**: Provides the `MatCard` component, likely used for displaying information in card-like structures within the dashboard.
* **`@angular/material/button`**: Provides the `MatButton` component, used for creating interactive buttons within the dashboard.

## 4. Declared Component

* **`DashboardComponent`**: This component is the primary constituent of the `DashboardModule`.  It's responsible for rendering the user interface of the dashboard.  Further details on the `DashboardComponent` itself would require separate documentation.


## 5.  No Exported Components

The `exports` array is empty, implying that the components declared within this module (`DashboardComponent`) are not directly accessible from other modules.  To use `DashboardComponent` in another module, that module must import `DashboardModule`.


## 6. No Defined Providers

The `providers` array is empty.  This means that no services are directly provided by this module. Any services required by `DashboardComponent` would need to be provided at a higher level in the application's module hierarchy.
